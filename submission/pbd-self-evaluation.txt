1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial
    a. How this application does it
        i. National IDs are not stored at all - they're only stored in a cryptographically hashed form
        ii. Ballots are dissociated from the user
    b. What we can do better
        i. We could non-deterministically encrypt the votes themselves
2. Privacy as the Default
    a. How this application does it
        i. National IDs are not stored at all - user doesn't have to opt-in for this
        ii. Ballots are dissociated from the user - user doesn't have to opt-in for this
    b. What we can do better
        i. Perhaps in the future, fraudulent voters should have their records cleared, after sufficient time has passed.
3. Privacy Embedded into Design
    a. How this application does it
        i. Other than the points above for proactive privacy, this application obfuscates ballot numbers so they're
           completely dissociated from the voter
    b. What we can do better
        ii. Nothing that hasn't already been mentioned in the "proactive" approach section
4. Full Functionality — Postive-Sum, not Zero-Sum
    a. How this application does it
        i. Voting is possible
        ii. Counting ballots is possible
        iii. Deregistration is possible
        iv. Fraud detection is possible
    b. What we can do better
        i. Fraud detection doesn't include the National IDs - it only includes the names of the users. While this is
           tractable, if a law enforcement agency can use the National IDs that they have access to in their own system
           to identify the correct voter who committed fraud, it also introduces friction. It could be done easier if
           the National IDs were encrypted, rather than hashed.
5. End-to-End Security — Lifecycle Protection
    a. How this application does it
        i. Critical data (National ID) is used only in its un-obfuscated form as the input.
    b. What we can do better
        ii. Similar to above.
6. Visibility and Transparency
    a. How this application does it
        i. This application communicates to the user that their ballot is secret, and their National ID is only used for
           registry verification
        ii. The application confirms to the user when the ballot has been counted
    b. What we can do better
        i. Open-sourcing the code
7. Respect for User Privacy
    a. How this application does it
        i. Similar to the points above - National IDs are protected, as are ballot numbers
    b. What we can do better
        ii. Similar to above points
